# Project Name
> Multiple Linear Regression model for prediction of demand of shared bikes.



<!-- You can include any other section that is pertinent to your problem -->

## General Information
- A US based company, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19
-  to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. 
- It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features.

## Conclusions
- Train R^2 is 0.788
- Adjusted Train R^2 is 0.765
- Test R^2 is 0.774
- Adjusted Train R^2 is 0.749
